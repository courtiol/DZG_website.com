title: "About this site"
---

We created this website using the R package [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) [<i class='fa fa-github'></i>](https://github.com/rstudio/distill) [<i class='fab fa-r-project'></i>](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/distill/index.html) -- a simple system for creating simple websites for those who know R.

We are aware that R is not the best tool for creating a website, but we wanted to give it a try.
We found the possibility to write a few lines of custom R code so as to generate tables of publications automatically particularly convenient.
The relevant references are selected from a BibTeX file on the basis of key words attached to the entries.

You can check our GitHub repository [<i class='fa fa-github'></i>](https://github.com/data-zoo-gang/DZG_website) to see how we coded everything, and you can check the [distillery](https://distillery.rbind.io/) for other websites created using {distill}.
