title: "About this site"

We created this website using the R package [{distill}](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/) -- a simple system for creating simple websites for those who know R and markdown.

You can check our GitHub repository [<i class='fa fa-github'></i>](https://github.com/data-zoo-gang/DZG_website) to see how we coded it, and you can check the [distillery](https://distillery.rbind.io/) for other websites created using {distill}.

We are aware that R is not the best tool for creating a website, but since we love R we wanted to give it a try.
