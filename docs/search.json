      "contents": "\n\nContents\nOutside academia\nWithin academia\n\nOutside academia\nWe do a fair a bit of training and consulting outside academia.\nWe do this for two main reasons:\nwe rely on some of our consulting fees to finance our research activities.\nwe are aware that conservation involves many actors who do not belong to universities or public research institutes.\nIf you are interested, please contact us.\nTopics\nOur technical expertise lies in R programming (including package development), data wrangling (in R), data visualisation (with or without R) and data analysis (in particular: traditional statistical tests, generalised linear models, mixed models, spatial analyses, survival analyses, random forests, individual-based simulations).\nYet as long as we feel competent enough to be useful, we are happy to offer consulting or training on any topic.\nWe always customise the content of training sessions to match the tasks and requirements of the client.\nHere are some representative examples of the training & consulting we are currently providing:\nworkshop for data visualisation organised by XXX.\ndevelopment of R packages and advanced R training for all data scientists at Factworks, a market research and analytics company.\nsupport in statistical analyses for the Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union in Germany (NABU), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) and the conservation NGO rewild.\nJust write to us and we will happily put you in contact with people we worked with for you to get direct feedback on how they perceived our work.\nPricing and the Robin Hood model\nOur pricing depends on the content, as well as on the number and identity of both the members from our team and the client’s.\nIf the work is for a for-profit company, our default protocol is to request the company to either pay our hosting institution (the IZW) or to pay one of the non-profit foundations we work with.\nIn both cases, the money is used by us as third party support for our research.\nWe call this the Robin Hood model, but this is hardly stealing: we remain very competitive compared to fees asked by equally qualified freelancers out there.\nIf the work is related to wildlife conservation or other activities we consider as highly beneficial to society as a whole, we try to provide a discount.\nFor a quote, please contact us.\nAvailability\nOur availability is what constrains the amount of consulting we do.\nWe can arrange regular short consultations or block consulting for a duration of up to 10 days, but we cannot offer more.\nIf you need more, just contact us and we will attempt to connect you to former members of the group and other people we know and trust who have become freelancers.\nWithin academia\nWe do not consult within academia with the exception of our local colleagues and students, as well as users of the methods we develop.\nInstead, we favour genuine collaborations where our role is not limited to performing the data analysis of someone else’s project.\nIf you are interested, please contact us.\nWe also teach both at the IZW and at the FU (see teaching for details).\n\n\n\n",

Initially trained as an evolutionary biologist with an additional emphasis on applied statistics, Alex has adopted ecology and demography after his PhD. He is mostly interested in humans, wild mammals and birds. His favorite research projects are those revealing unexpected outcomes. His focus is on questions related to life history and behaviour, but he is always open to new exciting collaborations. He likes programming and teaching R.\n\nLiam Bailey 🇦🇺\n\n\nMember since 2018. .\nLiam is a postdoc interested in understanding how ecosystems are affected by and respond to environmental change, particularly in the context of climate change. His research often involves long-term demographic datasets, and he loves using R and his experience as a data scientist to work with these data and answer scientific questions. While he started his research with birds, Liam has now branched out to include research with wild mammals. He also enjoys data visualization and teaching others how to visually communicate their ideas and scientific findings.\n\nLeonie Walter 🇩🇪\n\n\nMember since October 2022.\nAfter discovering her weird (yet unrequited) love towards stats and data science, Leonie joined the team for an internship during her Master in biology. She is planing to find out how mate choice impacts the distribution of relatedness in our favourite population of spotted hyenas. She may also use individual-based simulations to look at the consequences of inbreeding onto genetic diversity.\n\nAlexis Verfaillie 🇫🇷\n\n\nMember since January 2023. \nAlexis is a French master student interested in all kinds of cats. He is with us to study the inclusive fitness consequences of “coups” (unexpected changes occurring in social hierarchy) in… spotted hyenas. This animal is not a cat, but we convinced him it is close enough since hyenas belong to the suborder Feliformia. Like all of us, Alexis’ main pet won’t be a hyena however, nor a cat, not even a mouse, but rather a keyboard. That said, since what is his doing is computationally intensive he may even end up using purrr & furrr which should definitely meet his expectations.\n\nFormer members\nColin Vullioud 🇨🇭\n\n\nMember 2017-2021.\nColin came to us after getting fed up with social science research, learned R with us, and turned social behavior into algorithms.\nHe also created the R package {torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}.\nHe left the DZG as a fully fledged data scientist currently working as a freelancer in Berlin, Germany.\nHe is also an artist who has started to include R in his projects.\n\nElisa Donati 🇮🇹\n\n\nMember 2020.\nElisa came to program virtual hyenas and to work on our R package {hyenaR}.\nShe did this between a master’s thesis on lizards and a research project that involved setting up a complex simulation platform so as to model the coastal ecosystem of Venice, with a view to allowing sustainable exploitation by humans.\nShe now continues modelling coastal ecosystems, this time as a PhD student in Trieste, Italy.\n\nLouise Chevalier 🇫🇷\n\n\nMember 2019.\nLouise came for a few months during her PhD to do something else for a while. She worked with us on adding genetics to a simulation model about hyenas.\nThen, she returned to her PhD – building fancy demo-genetics models to better understand the role of demography and genomic constraints on the evolution of mate choice.\nShe is now a circus artist in France.\n\nIan Rickard 🇬🇧\n\n\nMember 2017-2018.\nIan came for a sabbatical from Durham University to study how twinning connects to fertility in humans, then switched career to become a data scientist for the ministry of justice in the UK. Ian and Alex were both postdocs in the same team in Sheffield (UK) headed by our collaborator Virpi Lummaa.\n\nRobert Schwieger 🇩🇪\n\n\nMember 2015-2016.\nRobert came to do maths on inference problems about mate choice before doing a PhD in applied mathematics on gene regulatory networks.\nHe is now working at CENTOGENE in Berlin, Germany.\n\nCamille Martinez Almoyna 🇫🇷\n\n\nMember 2015-2016.\nCamille did a joint internship here and in Montpellier developing stats methods to draw inferences using simulations. She then applied her statistics skills during her master’s project and PhD to study interactions in soil between plants and other lifeforms, across alpine elevation gradients. She is currently doing a postdoc in Grenoble, France.\n\nLoïc Etienne 🇫🇷\n\n\nMember 2012-2014.\nLoïc did his PhD with us, modelling the evolution of mutual mate choice.\nHe was co-supervised by Alex, our long standing collaborator François Rousset, and Bernard Godelle.\nAfter his PhD, Loïc worked as a high-school teacher, and he is now a full time musician in France.\n\nFriends\nNot quite members, not quite collaborators, but very close to us all the same!\nJörns Fickel 🇩🇪\n\n\nJörns Fickel is the wise Sensei in charge of the IZW Department of Evolutionary Genetics to which we belong.\nHe is also leading the course on conservation genetics to which we contribute.\nWe are delighted that he has our back, and effectively defend our interests within the IZW and beyond.\n\nIlja Heckmann 🇰🇿🇩🇪\nIlja is a biologist colleague turned full time python programmer and Linux admin from whom we never stop learning.\nZimai Li 🇨🇳\n\n\nZimai worked with us on our R package {hyenaR} while doing an internship with colleagues from the hyena project on mate choice in spotted hyenas.\nAfter his stay with us, he joined Yuko Ulrich to study interactions between infections and behaviour in clonal raider ants.\n\nMatthias Gallipaud 🇫🇷\n\n\nMatthias is a long standing idea bouncer for the DZG.\nHe did his PhD with François Xavier Dechaume-Moncharmont who was in Dijon at the time (now in Lyon) and then a postdoc with Hanna Kokko in Zurich, Switzerland.\nMatthias stayed in Zurich and is currently a data scientist working for UrbanDataLab, a startup specialising in GIS and spatial analyses. He also does statistical consulting, on the side, as a freelancer.\n\nMain collaborators\nFrançois Rousset 🇫🇷\n\n\nFrançois is a theoretical biologist at the Institut des Sciences de l’Evolution in Montpellier, France, turned hardcore statistician, author of R package {spaMM} without which we could not do half the work we do.\n\nOliver Höner 🇨🇭🇧🇷\n\n\nOliver is the leader of the hyena project.\nHe’s a behavioral ecologist and field biologist who turns anything hyena related into high quality datasets.\nOliver is based in the department of Evolutionary Ecology at the IZW.\nWe also collaborate intensively with Oliver’s student(s) – currently Arjun Dheer – and with other members of the project, especially co-leader Eve Davidian.\n\nViktoriia Radchuk 🇺🇦\n\n\nViktoriia is an individual-based modeler and the producer of big collaborative meta-analyses.\nLike us she flourishes at the interface between field and theory.\nShe is a key member of the department of Ecological Dynamics at the IZW.\n\nStephanie Kramer-Schadt 🇩🇪\n\n\nStephanie is head of the excellent department Ecological Dynamics at the IZW which is composed, almost exclusively, of great young scientists and students with strong quantitative skills.\n\nKseniia Kravchenko 🇺🇦\n\n\nKseniia has freshly finished her PhD at the BatLab from the IZW.\nShe is a batwomen with whom we try to predict the future distribution of hibernation niches by combining physiology and climate change.\n\nChristian Voigt 🇩🇪\n\n\nChristian is head of the department of Evolutionary Ecology at the IZW and head of the BatLab. His large team studies the ecophysiology of bats, as well as various topics relevant for the conservation of bats, such as their migration.\n\nVirpi Lummaa 🇫🇮\n\n\nVirpi is the life history data queen who has produced two of the very best demographic datasets that exist (one on pre-industrial humans and one on Asian Elephants).\nShe is head of the human life history science group and of the Myanmar Timber Elephant Project at the University of Turku in Finland.\n\nCollaborators wishlist\nThey never worked with us, but are very much like us, so we hope to work with them one day: Sarah Cubaynes 🇫🇷, Olivier Gimenez 🇫🇷, Samuel Pavard 🇫🇷, François Xavier Dechaume-Moncharmont 🇫🇷.\nThere is also Erik Postma 🇳🇱 with whom we worked a little already, but we would love to do more with him.\n\n\n\n",

Created and maintained by Liam.\n{IsoriX}   to build isoscapes using mixed models and infer the geographic origin of organisms based on their isotopic ratios. Created and maintained by Alex.\n{torpor}  to fit thermoregulatory curves in heterothermic endotherm species, while assigning metabolic rates to the correct physiological state. Created and maintained by Colin.\n{camtrapR}   to manage camera trap photographs in wildlife studies. We helped its maintainer – Jürgen Niedballa – to set it up while he was still a PhD student.\nFor all data scientists\n{spaMM}   to efficiently fit linear models of varying complexity, including mixed models with spatial autocorrelation. We contribute to its development mostly by using this package a lot, debugging it and suggesting new features. Maintained by one very close collaborator (François Rousset).\n{ABMR6}  an example of how to implement individual-based simulations using R6. Created by Alex, maintained by Liam.\n{timevarcorr}  to estimate time varying correlation coefficients using non-parametric kernel smoothing. Created and maintained by Alex.\nPrivate (for now)\n{hyenaR}  to manage most of the data generated by the hyena project. Created and maintained by Liam and Alex.\n{HyenaPopmod}  to perform individual-based simulations mimicking the hyenas followed by the hyena project. Created and maintained by Liam.\nThese packages will become open when we judge them ready for others to use.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

We include both introductory techniques using Microsoft Excel and more advanced techniques in R. This workshop is run for the Ngorongoro Conservation Area Authority, which allows local conservation managers to use weather data for their conservation goals.\n\n\n\n\nFormer teaching\n\n\nAdvanced course: Solving problems in biostatistical analysis and experimental design in the Life Sciences\nAlex taught this course, for several years, at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (or IZW).\nThe point of this course was primarily to discuss and resolve every participant’s (statistical) problem.\nThe course is no longer running since it became redundant with the fortnightly statistical seminars at the IZW, which we co-organise with Emanuel Heitlinger.\n\nOther former courses\n\n\n- In Berlin (Germany), Alex has taught the course Current and classic topics in Evolution and Ecology at the Freie Universität, to replace Jens Rolff who was on sabbatical.\n\n\n\n- In Sheffield (UK), during his postdoc, Alex taught an introduction to R with Andrew Beckerman.\n\n\n\n- In Montpellier (France), during his PhD, Alex taught population genetics and various practicals in ecology.\n\n\n\n© Alexandre Courtiol\n\n\n\n\n",
