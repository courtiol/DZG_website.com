## Current members

- [Alexandre Courtiol](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/alex-courtiol-en.html)ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (member since 2011)[<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> perso](https://twitter.com/alexcourtiol), [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> R](https://twitter.com/rdataberlin). Senior researcher, lecturer. Initially trained as an evolutionary biologist with a solid formation in applied statistics, Alex has adopted ecology and demography after his PhD. He is mostly interested in humans, wild mammals and birds. His favorite research projects are those revealing unexpected outcomes. His focus is on questions related to life history and behaviour, but he is always open to new exciting collaborations. He likes programming and teaching R.

- [Liam Bailey](https://www.liamdbailey.com)ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º (member since 2018) [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i>](https://twitter.com/ldbailey255). Postdoc. SHORT 3rd PERSON DESCRIPTION TODO.

- [Colin Vullioud](https://de.linkedin.com/in/colin-vullioud-a7a500186)ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­ (member 20XX-20XX) came to us after getting fed up with social science research, learned R with us, turned social behavior into algorithms and left as a full fledged data scientist currently working as a free lancer in Berlin, Germany. He also created the R package {torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}.

- [Elisa Donati](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisa-Donati)ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹ (member 2020) came to programs virtual hyenas and to work our R package {hyneaR} between a master on lizards and an upcoming PhD student in Italy.

- Louise ChevalierðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (member 2019) came for a few months during her PhD to do something else for a while. She worked with us on adding genetics to a simulation model about hyenas. Now a circus artist in France.

- [Ian Rickard](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/ianjaric)ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ (member 2017-2018) came for a sabbatical from Durham University to study how twinning connects to fertility in humans, then switched career to become a data scientist for the ministry of justice in the UK.

- [Robert Schwieger](https://de.linkedin.com/in/robert-schwieger-431ab4197)ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª (member 2015-2016) came to do maths for fun on inference problems about mate choice before doing a PhD in mathematics. Now working at [CENTOGENE](https://www.centogene.com) in Berlin, Germany.

- [Camille Martinez](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camille-Martinez-Almoyna)ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (member 2015-2016) did a joint-internship here and in Montpellier developing stats methods to draw inference using simulation before starting her PhD. Currently doing a postdoc in Grenoble, France.

- LoÃ¯c EtienneðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· (member 2010-2014) did his PhD with us doing modelling about the evolution of mutual mate choice. Now a musician in France.
