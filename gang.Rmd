### [Alexandre Courtiol](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/alex-courtiol-en.html) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Member since 2011. [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> perso](https://twitter.com/alexcourtiol), [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> R](https://twitter.com/rdataberlin).
Senior researcher, lecturer. Initially trained as an evolutionary biologist with a solid formation in applied statistics, Alex has adopted ecology and demography after his PhD. He is mostly interested in humans, wild mammals and birds. His favorite research projects are those revealing unexpected outcomes. His focus is on questions related to life history and behaviour, but he is always open to new exciting collaborations. He likes programming and teaching R.

### [Colin Vullioud](https://de.linkedin.com/in/colin-vullioud-a7a500186) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­
Member 2017-2021.
Colin came to us after getting fed up with social science research, learned R with us, turned social behavior into algorithms.
He also created the R package {torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}.
He left the DZG as a full fledged data scientist currently working as a free lancer in Berlin, Germany.
He is also an artist who has started to include R in his projects.

### [Elisa Donati](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Elisa-Donati) ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡¹
Member 2020. 
Elisa came to program virtual hyenas and to work on our R package {hyneaR}. She did this in-between a master on lizards and a research project that involved setting up a complex simulation platform so as to model the coastal ecosystem of Venice, in view of sustainable exploitation by humans.
She is now looking for a PhD in Italy (too bad for us, otherwise we would have kept her here in Berlin!).

### Louise Chevalier ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Member 2019.
Louise came for a few months during her PhD to do something else for a while. She worked with us on adding genetics to a simulation model about hyenas. Then, she finished her PhD building fancy demo-genetics models to better understand the role of demography and genomic constraints on the evolution of mate choice. Now a circus artist in France.

Member 2017-2018.
Ian came for a sabbatical from Durham University to study how twinning connects to fertility in humans, then switched career to become a data scientist for the ministry of justice in the UK. Ian and Alex were both postdocs in the same team in Sheffield (UK) headed by our collaborator [Virpi Lummaa](#VL).

### [Robert Schwieger](https://de.linkedin.com/in/robert-schwieger-431ab4197) ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª
Member 2015-2016.
Robert came to do maths for fun on inference problems about mate choice before doing a PhD in applied mathematics on gene regulatory networks.
Now working at [CENTOGENE](https://www.centogene.com) in Berlin, Germany.

### [Camille Martinez Almoyna](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Camille-Martinez-Almoyna) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Member 2015-2016.
Camille did a joint-internship here and in Montpellier developing stats methods to draw inference using simulation. She then applied her statistics skills during her master project and PhD to study interactions in soil between plants and other lifeforms, across alpine elevation gradients. Currently doing a postdoc in Grenoble, France.

### LoÃ¯c Etienne ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
Member 2010-2014.
LoÃ¯c did his PhD with us doing modelling about the evolution of mutual mate choice.
He was co-supervised by Alex, our long standing collaborator [FranÃ§ois Rousset](#FR), and [Bernard Godelle](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Bernard-Godelle-2). 
After his PhD, LoÃ¯c works as a highschool teacher, and he is now a full time musician in France.
