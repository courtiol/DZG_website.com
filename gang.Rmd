<img src="images/alex_courtiol.jpg">
Member and boss of the DZG since 2012. [<i class='fa-brands fa-bluesky'></i> <i class='fa fa-flask'></i>](https://bsky.app/profile/datazoogang.de), [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i> <i class='fab fa-r-project'></i>](https://twitter.com/rdataberlin)

Senior researcher, lecturer. Initially trained as an evolutionary biologist with an additional emphasis on applied statistics, Alex has adopted ecology and demography after his PhD. He is mostly interested in humans, wild mammals and birds. His favorite research projects are those revealing unexpected outcomes. His focus is on questions related to life history and behaviour, but he is always open to new exciting collaborations. He likes programming and teaching R.

<img src="images/vladislav_marcuk.jpg">
Member since 2024. Despite having a full time job as a curator looking after some of the most endangered parrots in the world, Vladi took on to do a PhD with us in his spare time. He is trying to figure out how science could help improve the ex-situ breeding of Spix's macaws in view of reintroducing the species successfully into the wild. Vladi is also an artist who creates beautiful hand-drawings of his beloved creatures.

### Ben Battersby ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º

:::float-left-gang
<img src="images/ben_battersby.jpg">
Member during the month of July 2025. Ben came for a short stay to strengthen his R skills and teach us about wildebeest (also known as gnu). He is running a long-term study on the movement of these wild beasts in Tanzania and he has published a beautiful picture book about them. If you visit us, you will also see one of Ben's painting in the office. Like several other members he is an accomplished artist as well as a scientist.

### Leonie Walter ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª

:::float-right-gang
<img src="images/leonie_walter.jpg">
Member October 2022 to November 2024.
After discovering her weird (yet unrequited) love towards stats and data science, Leonie joined the team for an internship during her Master in biology. She then stayed for her master thesis to find out the demographic cost of inbreeding depression in our favourite population of spotted hyenas. After that she became the gang's research assistant.

### Alexis Verfaillie ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

:::float-left-gang
<img src="images/alexis_verfaillie.jpg">
Member January to June 2023. [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i>](https://twitter.com/alexisverf)
Alexis did his master thesis in our group. He is interested in all kinds of cats. He was with us to study the inclusive fitness consequences of "coups" (unexpected changes occurring in social hierarchy) in... spotted hyenas. This animal is not a cat, but we convinced him it is close enough since hyenas belong to the suborder *Feliformia*.

### [Liam Bailey](https://www.liamdbailey.com) ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡º

:::float-right-gang
<img src="images/liam_bailey.jpg">
Member 2018-2023. [<i class='fa fa-twitter'></i>](https://twitter.com/ldbailey255).
Liam came to the group as a postdoc interested in understanding how ecosystems are affected by and respond to environmental change, particularly in the context of climate change. His research often involves long-term demographic datasets, and he loves using R and his experience as a data scientist to work with these data and answer scientific questions. While he started his research with birds, since he came to us, Liam has branched out to include research with wild mammals. He also enjoys data visualization and teaching others how to visually communicate their ideas and scientific findings. Liam is now working for the WWF as a data scientist.

:::float-left-gang
<img src="images/colin_vullioud.jpg">
Member 2017-2021.
Colin came to us after getting fed up with social science research, learned R with us, and turned social behavior into algorithms.
He also created the R package {torpor} and contributed to {hyenaR}.
He left the DZG as a fully fledged data scientist and after spending a few years as a freelancer in Berlin, Colin is now doing a PhD in Freiburg, simulating forests use.
He is also an artist who has started to include R in his projects.

:::float-right-gang
<img src="images/elisa_donati.jpg">
Member 2020. 
Elisa came to program virtual hyenas and to work on our R package {hyenaR}.
She did this between a master's thesis on lizards and a research project that involved setting up a complex simulation platform so as to model the coastal ecosystem of Venice, with a view to allowing sustainable exploitation by humans.
She now continues modelling coastal ecosystems, this time as a PhD student in Trieste, Italy.

### Louise Chevalier ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

:::float-left-gang
<img src="images/louise_chevalier.jpg">
Member 2019.
Louise came for a few months during her PhD to do something else for a while. She worked with us on adding genetics to a simulation model about hyenas.
Then, she returned to her PhD -- building fancy demo-genetics models to better understand the role of demography and genomic constraints on the evolution of mate choice.
She is now a circus artist in France.

Member 2015-2016.
Camille did a joint internship here and in Montpellier developing stats methods to draw inferences using simulations. She then applied her statistics skills during her master's project and PhD to study interactions in soil between plants and other lifeforms, across alpine elevation gradients. She is currently doing a postdoc in Grenoble, France.
