	abstract = {Maternal investment influences the survival and reproduction of both mothers and their progeny and plays a crucial role in understanding individuals{\textquoteright} life-history and population ecology. To reveal the complex mechanisms associated with reproduction and investment, it is necessary to examine variations in maternal investment across species. Comparisons across species call for a standardised method to quantify maternal investment, which remained to be developed. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing the maternal investment metric {\textendash} MI {\textendash}~for mammalian species, established through the allometric scaling of the litter mass at weaning age by the adult mass and investment duration (i.e. gestation + lactation duration) of a species. Using a database encompassing hundreds of mammalian species, we show that the metric is not highly sensitive to the regression method used to fit the allometric relationship or to the proxy used for adult body mass. The comparison of the maternal investment metric between mammalian subclasses and orders reveals strong differences across taxa. For example, our metric confirms that Eutheria have a higher maternal investment than Metatheria. We discuss how further research could use the maternal investment metric as a valuable tool to understand variation in reproductive strategies.},

	abstract = {Motion-triggered light-emitting diodes (LED) could reduce light pollution; however, its effect on nocturnal animals is poorly known. Here, we investigated how bats respond to the motion-triggered lighting of a bicycle path, an infrastructure that is increasingly being built to support human mobility. We measured the acoustic activity of bats in relation to the activity of LED lights. The responses of bats varied during the night and between functional guilds: Edge-space foraging bats avoided LED lighting, but the response was less clear during early and late night. Open-space foraging and narrow-space foraging bats avoided the LED lighting, especially late at night. The foraging intensity remained relatively stable across the night for bats of all guilds. We conclude that the motion-sensitive LED lighting of bicycle paths induces a guild-specific avoidance response in bats, which could be mitigated by shorter lighting periods.},

	abstract = {Identifying the environmental drivers of variation in fitness-related traits is a central objective in ecology and evolutionary biology. Temporal fluctuations of these environmental drivers are often synchronized at large spatial scales. Yet, whether synchronous environmental conditions can generate spatial synchrony in fitness-related trait values (i.e., correlated temporal trait fluctuations across populations) is poorly understood. Using data from long-term monitored populations of blue tits (Cyanistes caeruleus, n = 31), great tits (Parus major, n = 35) and pied flycatchers (Ficedula hypoleuca, n = 20) across Europe, we assessed the influence of two local climatic variables (mean temperature and mean precipitation in February-May) on spatial synchrony in three fitness-related traits: laying date, clutch size, and fledgling number. We found a high degree of spatial synchrony in laying date, but a lower degree in clutch size and fledgling number for each species. Temperature strongly influenced spatial synchrony in laying date for resident blue tits and great tits, but not for migratory pied flycatchers. This is an important finding in the context of environmental impacts on populations because spatial synchrony in fitness-related trait values among populations may influence fluctuations in vital rates or population abundances. If environment-induced spatial synchrony in fitness-related traits increases the spatial synchrony in vital rates or population abundances, this will ultimately increase the risk of extinction for populations and species. Assessing how environmental conditions influence spatiotemporal variation in trait values improves our mechanistic understanding of environmental impacts on populations.},

	abstract = {The acute phase response (APR) is an evolutionarily well-conserved part of the innate immune defense against pathogens. However, recent studies in bats yielded surprisingly diverse results compared to previous APR studies on both vertebrate and invertebrate species. This is especially interesting due to the known role of bats as reservoirs for viruses and other intracellular pathogens, while being susceptible to extracellular microorganisms such as some bacteria and fungi. To better understand these discrepancies and the reservoir-competence of bats, we mimicked bacterial, viral and fungal infections in greater mouse-eared bats (Myotis myotis) and quantified different aspects of the APR over a two-day period. Individuals reacted most strongly to a viral (PolyI:C) and a bacterial (LPS) antigen, reflected by an increase of haptoglobin levels (LPS) and an increase of the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte-ratio (PolyI:C and LPS). We did not detect fever, leukocytosis, body mass loss, or a change in the overall functioning of the innate immunity upon challenge with any antigen. We add evidence that bats respond selectively with APR to specific pathogens and that the activation of different parts of the immune system is species-specific.},

Here we show in {\textgreater}20k pre-industrial European mothers that this interpretation results from an ecological fallacy: twinners had more births not due to higher intrinsic fertility, but because mothers that gave birth more accumulated more opportunities to produce twins. Controlling for variation in the exposure to the risk of twinning reveals that mothers with higher twinning propensity {\textendash} a physiological predisposition to producing twins {\textendash} had fewer births, and when twin mortality was high, fewer offspring reaching adulthood. Twinning rates may thus be driven by variation in its mortality costs, rather than variation in intrinsic fertility.},

	abstract = {Aim In many species, density-dependent effects on reproduction are an important driver of population dynamics. However, it is rarely considered that the direction of density dependence is expected to vary over space and time depending on anti-predator behaviour and predator community. Aggregation may allow for effective group mobbing against avian nest predators while aggregation may also attract mammalian predators, causing negative density dependence. We aim to quantify spatial variation in the effect of conspecific breeding density on nest survival in a mobbing bird species (Eurasian oystercatcher; Haematopus ostralegus) and identify whether this variation in density dependence can be explained by the predator community. Location Country-wide (The Netherlands). Methods We integrated reproductive data with breeding territory maps of Eurasian oystercatchers and occupancy maps of avian and mammalian predator species across the Netherlands for a 10-year period. Results Spatial variation in the composition of the predator community explained the effects of neighbour density, showing decreasing nest survival when both conspecific density and mammalian dominance increased. Also, heterospecific density (from breeding godwits and lapwing) has an additional effect on the oystercatcher nest survival. Strikingly, this pattern did not extend to mammal-free island populations. Main conclusions Our study provides evidence that both the strength and sign of density dependence can vary spatially within species, implying that it is dangerous to generalize results from a single local population to large-scale management implications and modelling exercises. The study also suggests that conservation actions that aim to attract breeding birds should be prioritized in areas with fewer mammalian predators, but this idea requires further testing on island populations.},

Assigning measurements of M to torpor or euthermy can be challenging, especially when the difference between euthermic M and torpid M is small, in species defending a high minimal body temperature in torpor, in thermolabile species, and slightly below the thermoneutral zone (TNZ). Here, we propose a novel method for distinguishing torpor from euthermy. We use the variation in M measured during euthermic rest and torpor at varying ambient temperatures (Ta) to objectively estimate the lower critical temperature (Tlc) of the TNZ and to assign measurements to torpor, euthermic rest or rest within TNZ. In addition, this method allows the prediction of M during euthermic rest and torpor at varying Ta, including resting M within the TNZ. The present method has shown highly satisfactory results using 28 published sets of metabolic data obtained by respirometry on 26 species of mammals. Ultimately, this novel method aims to facilitate analysis of respirometry data in heterothermic endotherms. Finally, the development of the associated R-package (torpor) will enable widespread use of the method amongst biologists.},

Although effects on behaviour are well studied, studies of effects on fitness and physiology are scarce, particularly for group-living species. We exploited a natural experimental setup to investigate the effect of diurnal pastoralism on juvenile recruitment and allostatic load in a population of free-ranging spotted hyenas in the Ngorongoro Crater, Tanzania, over a 24-year period. Pastoralism was restricted to the territories of two of the eight study clans, allowing us to compare juvenile recruitment in exposed and unexposed clans. We also compared faecal glucocorticoid metabolite concentrations (fGMC){\textemdash}a biomarker of an organism's allostatic load{\textemdash}between exposed and unexposed clans using 975 faecal samples from 475 hyenas. We found no detectable difference in juvenile recruitment nor fGMC between the exposed and unexposed clans, indicating that the pastoralism had no substantial deleterious effect on the spotted hyenas. The lack of a deleterious effect likely stems from the combined effect of the predictable and undisruptive nature of the pastoralism, the socio-ecology of spotted hyenas and the Ngorongoro Crater's consistently abundant prey. Our findings demonstrate that exposure to anthropogenic activity may be compatible with the persistence of certain group-living species, especially if the overlap between the species' critical behaviours and the activity is limited. Our study thereby provides new perspectives for ecologists, conservation biologists and stakeholders who seek to assess human{\textendash}wildlife conflicts and balance the needs of local human communities and wildlife.},

              The phenology of many species shows strong sensitivity to climate change; however, with few large scale intra-specific studies it is unclear how such sensitivity varies over a species{\textquoteright} range. We document large intra-specific variation in phenological sensitivity to temperature using laying date information from 67 populations of two co-familial European songbirds, the great tit (

              Cyanistes caeruleus
              ), covering a large part of their breeding range. Populations inhabiting deciduous habitats showed stronger phenological sensitivity than those in evergreen and mixed habitats. However, populations with higher sensitivity tended to have experienced less rapid change in climate over the past decades, such that populations with high phenological sensitivity will not necessarily exhibit the strongest phenological advancement. Our results show that to effectively assess the impact of climate change on phenology across a species{\textquoteright} range it will be necessary to account for intra-specific variation in phenological sensitivity, climate change exposure, and the ecological characteristics of a population.},

We project that effective management of this expanded system will require approximately 3 million personnel (one per 13 km2), including more than 1.5 million rangers or equivalents (one per 26 km2). Parallel improvements in resourcing, working conditions and capacity are required for effective, equitable and sustainable management.},

	abstract = {In conservation science, observation-based methods are generally applied to wildlife monitoring. While useful, such approaches are often restricted to well-characterized and conspicuous species. Environmental DNA (eDNA) can complement observation-dependent surveys, as sample collection is generally less labor-intensive. Furthermore, eDNA can be used to simultaneously detect multiple taxa in various habitats. Most eDNA applications rely on short PCR product-based meta-barcoding approaches. However, such approaches may be less robust when applied to genetically uncharacterized species. Hybridization capture techniques while less sensitive than metabarcoding, can identifying divergent sequences, especially those obtained from highly degraded DNA. To assess eDNA based methods for surveillance in a conservation context, we collected samples during the dry season from randomly selected waterholes from a protected area in eastern Cambodia. We applied both hybridization capture enrichment and metabarcoding targeting mammal mitogenomes to water (N~=~46) and sediment (N~=~10) samples. Seventeen species were detected, including 11 mammals, three amphibians, two reptiles, and one bird. Six species overlapped between the two applied methods. Seven species were hybridization capture-specific detections, and four were metabarcoding-specific. Metabarcoding was more sensitive to abundant or large body-size species while hybridization capture provided more mitogenomic information. While both methods have some advantages over observational approaches, combining them may improve the sensitivity, number of species detected and amount of genetic information obtained from eDNA. We demonstrate that eDNA from tropical forest waterholes can be used to determine the presence of wildlife that may be difficult to detect using other observational approaches.},

	abstract = {In eusocial insects, offspring survival strongly depends on the quality and quantity of non-breeders. In contrast, the influence of social factors on offspring survival is more variable in cooperatively breeding mammals since maternal traits also play an important role. This difference between cooperative insects and mammals is generally attributed to the difference in the level of sociality. Examining offspring survival in eusocial mammals should, therefore, clarify to what extent social organization and taxonomic differences determine the relative contribution of non-breeders and maternal effects to offspring survival. Here, we present the first in-depth and long-term study on the influence of individual, maternal, social and environmental characteristics on early offspring survival in a eusocial breeding mammal, the naked mole-rat (Heterocephalus glaber). Similarly to other mammals, pup birth mass and maternal characteristics such as body mass and the number of mammae significantly affected early pup survival. In this eusocial species, the number of non-breeders had a significant influence on early pup survival, but this influence was negative{\textemdash}potentially an artifact of captivity. By contrasting our findings with known determinants of survival in eusocial insects we contribute to a better understanding of the origin and maintenance of eusociality in mammals.},

Long-term studies of individually marked animals are not an exception. These studies are especially important as instrumental for understanding evolutionary and ecological processes in the wild. Furthermore, their number and global distribution provides a unique opportunity to assess the generality of patterns and to address broad-scale global issues (e.g. climate change). To solve data integration issues and enable a new scale of ecological and evolutionary research based on long-term studies of birds, we have created the SPI-Birds Network and Database (www.spibirds.org){\textemdash}a large-scale initiative that connects data from, and researchers working on, studies of wild populations of individually recognizable (usually ringed) birds. Within year and a half since the establishment, SPI-Birds has recruited over 120 members, and currently hosts data on almost 1.5 million individual birds collected in 80 populations over 2,000 cumulative years, and counting. SPI-Birds acts as a data hub and a catalogue of studied populations. It prevents data loss, secures easy data finding, use and integration and thus facilitates collaboration and synthesis. We provide community-derived data and meta-data standards and improve data integrity guided by the principles of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable (FAIR), and aligned with the existing metadata languages (e.g. ecological meta-data language). The encouraging community involvement stems from SPI-Bird's decentralized approach: research groups retain full control over data use and their way of data management, while SPI-Birds creates tailored pipelines to convert each unique data format into a standard format. We outline the lessons learned, so that other communities (e.g. those working on other taxa) can adapt our successful model. Creating community-specific hubs (such as ours, COMADRE for animal demography, etc.) will aid much-needed large-scale ecological data integration.},

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Understanding the causes of range expansions in abundant species can help predict future species distributions. During range expansions, animals are exposed to novel environments and are required to cope with new and unpredictable stressors. Glucocorticoids (GCs) are mediators of the hormonal and behavioural mechanisms allowing animals to cope with unpredictable changes in the environment and are therefore expected to differ between populations at expansion edge and the historic range. However, to date, very few studies have evaluated the relationship between GCs and range expansion. The Egyptian mongoose has been rapidly expanding its range in Portugal over the past 30~years. In this study, we applied an information theoretic approach to determine the most important spatial and environmental predictors of hair GCs (hGCs) in the population, after controlling for normal patterns of hGC variation in the species. We observed a decrease in hGC as distance from the historic range increased (i.e. closer to the expansion front). This distance term was present in all of the top models and had a 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) that did not overlap with zero, strongly supporting its influence on hGC. We estimated a 0.031~pg/mg (95\% CI: -0.057, -0.004) decrease in hGCs for each kilometre distance to the Tagus River, which was once the limit of the species{\textquoteright} distribution. Our results indicate that the species{\textquoteright} expansion is unlikely to be limited by mechanisms related to or mediated by the physiological stress response. The decrease in hGC levels towards the expansion edge coupled with limited evidence of a negative effect of human population density suggests that the species{\textquoteright} northward expansion in Portugal could continue.},

          ,  
             
              Although significantly more money is spent on the conservation of tigers than on any other threatened species, today only 3200 to 3600 tigers roam the forests of Asia, occupying only 7\% of their historical range. Despite the global significance of and interest in tiger conservation, global approaches to plan tiger recovery are partly impeded by the lack of a consensus on the number of tiger subspecies or management units, because a comprehensive analysis of tiger variation is lacking. We analyzed variation among all nine putative tiger subspecies, using extensive data sets of several traits [morphological (craniodental and pelage), ecological, molecular]. Our analyses revealed little variation and large overlaps in each trait among putative subspecies, and molecular data showed extremely low diversity because of a severe Late Pleistocene population decline. Our results support recognition of only two subspecies: the Sunda tiger, 
              Panthera tigris sondaica, 
              and the continental tiger, 
              Panthera tigris tigris 
              , which consists of two (northern and southern) management units. Conservation management programs, such as captive breeding, reintroduction initiatives, or trans-boundary projects, rely on a durable, consistent characterization of subspecies as taxonomic units, defined by robust multiple lines of scientific evidence rather than single traits or ad hoc descriptions of one or few specimens. Our multiple-trait data set supports a fundamental rethinking of the conventional tiger taxonomy paradigm, which will have profound implications for the management of in situ and ex situ tiger populations and boost conservation efforts by facilitating a pragmatic approach to tiger conservation management worldwide.},

All samples were subjected to the following density-gradient centrifugation treatments: no centrifugation (control), sham centrifugation, Percoll, OptiPrep, Isolate and PureSperm. Sample evaluation included motility, concentration, viability, acrosome integrity and normal morphology after thawing and after gradient centrifugation. Motility was also evaluated 3 h after thawing. While all treatments were similar to the Control in acrosome integrity and normal morphology, significant differences were noted in concentration, viability and motility. Samples treated by Percoll showed the best motility, which was maintained unchanged over 3 h of incubation (37{\textdegree}C). Correlations between manual and automated evaluations of concentration were high (cytometer; rho = 0.92), but were lower for viability (cytometer; rho = 0.57) and motility (computer-aided sperm analysis; rho = 0.66). By performing density centrifugation, the quality of these sperm samples may be improved to a level suitable for artificial insemination in elephants. Although a sizeable proportion of cells are lost in the process, combining samples may still allow for multiple inseminations.},

	abstract = {Most theoretical research in sexual selection has focused on indirect selection. However, empirical studies have not strongly supported indirect selection. A well-established finding is that direct benefits and costs exert a strong influence on the evolution of mate choice. We present an analytical model in which unilateral mate choice evolves solely by direct sexual selection on choosiness. We show this is sufficient to generate the evolution of all possible levels of choosiness, because of the fundamental trade-off between mating rate and mating benefits. We further identify the relative searching time (RST, i.e. the proportion of lifetime devoted to searching for mates) as a predictor of the effect of any variable affecting the mating rate on the evolution of choosiness. We show that the RST: (i) allows one to make predictions about the evolution of choosiness across a wide variety of mating systems; (ii) encompasses all alternative variables proposed thus far to explain the evolution of choosiness by direct sexual selection; and (iii) can be empirically used to infer qualitative differences in choosiness.},

	abstract = {Influenza A viruses (IAV) are zoonotic pathogens relevant to human, domestic animal and wildlife health. Many avian IAVs are transmitted among waterfowl via a faecal-oral-route. Therefore, environmental water where waterfowl congregate may play an important role in the ecology and epidemiology of avian IAV. Water and sediment may sustain and transmit virus among individuals or species. It is unclear at what concentrations waterborne viruses are infectious or remain detectable. To address this, we performed lake water and sediment dilution experiments with varying concentrations or infectious doses of four IAV strains from seal, turkey, duck and gull. To test for infectivity of the IAV strains in a concentration dependent manner, we applied cultivation to specific pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs and Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. IAV recovery was more effective from embryonated chicken eggs than MDCK cells for freshwater lake dilutions, whereas, MDCK cells were more effective for viral recovery from sediment samples. Low infectious dose (1 PFU/200 $\mu$L) was sufficient in most cases to detect and recover IAV from lake water dilutions. Sediment required higher initial infectious doses (>= 100 PFU/200 $\mu$L).},

	abstract = {Background. 
              Retroviral integration into the host germline results in permanent viral colonization of vertebrate genomes. The koala retrovirus (KoRV) is currently invading the germline of the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus) and provides a unique opportunity for studying retroviral endogenization. Previous analysis of KoRV integration patterns in modern koalas demonstrate that they share integration sites primarily if they are related, indicating that the process is currently driven by vertical transmission rather than infection. However, due to methodological challenges, KoRV integrations have not been comprehensively characterized. 
             
             
              Results. 
              To overcome these challenges, we applied and compared three target enrichment techniques coupled with next generation sequencing (NGS) and a newly customized sequence-clustering based computational pipeline to determine the integration sites for 10 museum Queensland and New South Wales (NSW) koala samples collected between the 1870s and late 1980s. A secondary aim of this study sought to identify common integration sites across modern and historical specimens by comparing our dataset to previously published studies. Several million sequences were processed, and the KoRV integration sites in each koala were characterized. 
             
             
              Conclusions. 
              Although the three enrichment methods each exhibited bias in integration site retrieval, a combination of two methods, Primer Extension Capture and hybridization capture is recommended for future studies on historical samples. Moreover, identification of integration sites shows that the proportion of integration sites shared between any two koalas is quite small.},

          ,  
            Dispersal is a key driver of ecological and evolutionary processes. Despite substantial efforts to explain the evolution of dispersal, we still do not fully understand why individuals of the same sex of a species vary in their propensity to disperse. The dominant hypothesis emphasizes movements and assumes that leaving home (dispersal) and staying at home (philopatry) are two alternative strategies providing different fitness. It suggests that only individuals of high phenotypic quality can pursue the most beneficial strategy; the others are left to do a {\textquotedblleft}best-of-a-bad{\textquotedblright} job. An alternative hypothesis emphasizes settlement decisions and suggests that all individuals pursue a single strategy of choosing the breeding habitat or group with the highest fitness prospects; choosing the natal group (philopatry) and choosing a nonnatal group (dispersal) are then outcomes of these decisions. We tested both hypotheses using a long-term study of a free-ranging population of a group-living carnivore, the spotted hyena. We combined demographic data with data on dispersal-relevant phenotypic traits, breeding-group choice, survival, and reproductive success of 254 males. Our results contradict the best-of-a-bad-job hypothesis: philopatric males and dispersers were of similar phenotypic quality, had similar fitness, and applied similar settlement rules based on the fitness prospects in groups. Our findings demonstrate that the distribution of breeding partners can be more important in shaping dispersal patterns than the costs associated with the dispersal movement. The study provides novel insights into the processes leading to the coexistence of philopatry and dispersal within the same sex of a species.},

	abstract = {By 2040, roughly two-thirds of humanity are expected to live in urban areas. As cities expand, humans irreversibly transform natural ecosystems, creating both opportunities and challenges for wildlife. Here, we investigate how the Northern Goshawk ( 
              Accipiter gentilis 
              ) is adjusting to urban environments. We measured a variety of behavioural and ecological parameters in three urban and four rural study sites. City life appeared related to all parameters we measured. Urban female goshawks were overall 21.7 (CI 
              95\% 
              5.13{\textendash}130) times more likely to defend their nestlings from humans than rural females. Urban goshawks were 3.64 (CI 
              95\% 
              2.05{\textendash}6.66) times more likely to feed on pigeons and had diets exhibiting lower overall species richness and diversity. Urban females laid eggs 12.5 (CI 
              95\% 
              7.12{\textendash}17.4) days earlier than rural individuals and were 2.22 (CI 
              95\% 
              0.984{\textendash}4.73) times more likely to produce a brood of more than three nestlings. Nonetheless, urban goshawks suffered more from infections with the parasite 
              Trichomonas gallinae 
              , which was the second most common cause of mortality (14.6\%), after collisions with windows (33.1\%). In conclusion, although city life is associated with significant risks, goshawks appear to thrive in some urban environments, most likely as a result of high local availability of profitable pigeon prey. We conclude that the Northern Goshawk can be classified as an urban exploiter in parts of its distribution.},

	abstract = {Many migratory species have shifted their geographic distribution in response to climate change, yet the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, particularly for mammals. We hypothesized that generational shifts are underlying the observed colonization of hibernation sites further north in a migratory bat, the common noctule ( 
              Nyctalus noctula) 
              . To evaluate our hypothesis, we collected long-term data on the migratory status and demography of common noctules in a recently colonized hibernation area. Based on isotopic data of 413 individuals, we observed a significant decline in the proportion of long-distance migrants from 2004 to 2015 for both sexes and across all age groups. Demographic data collected between 2007 and 2016 from 3394 individuals demonstrated that subadult males were more abundant during the early colonization stage, followed by a gradual shift to a more balanced age and sex composition. Our results suggest that the colonization of hibernacula at higher latitudes is promoted by generational shifts, involving mostly first-year males. Generational shifts seem to be a likely mechanism for distribution changes in other bats and potentially also in other mammals.},

	abstract = {Understanding the selection of breeding sites in cities is key for the effective management of urban bird populations. We analysed 16 years of data collected within a relocation program for female mallards in Berlin (Germany), with the goal of (i) characterizing the breeding output and breeding sites in urban environments, (ii) identifying factors correlating with probabilities of individuals to return to previously used breeding sites (i.e. breeding site fidelity) and (iii) assessing the consequences of ongoing management strategies on the selection of breeding sites. Mallards using anthropogenic structures for breeding primarily chose balconies, roof terraces and courtyards. In 22.8\% of cases, mallards selected the same sites in subsequent breeding events. Breeding site fidelity decreased with higher human population density at that location, and decreased as mallard families were relocated further away from the breeding site to a suitable water body. In contrast, return probabilities were higher for subsequent broods within the same breeding season than across two successive seasons. Above all, the identity of the breeding location and the identity of the female best predicted whether an individual would return to a given breeding site. We conclude that breeding site fidelity in urban mallards is strongly shaped by micro-scale location-specific properties (e.g. balcony characteristics), as well as individual variation due to an intrinsic propensity for site fidelity. We argue that adequate management for waterfowl in urban environments depends on why birds choose to breed on anthropogenic structures, on their conservation status and the availability of breeding sites around urban waters.},

	abstract = {Predicting species range shifts in response to environmental change requires the determination of regions where individuals maintain a positive energy budget. For hibernating animals, this budget depends on two physiological states (normothermy and torpor) that alternate in response to ambient temperature. To study range shifts of hibernators like the common noctule (
Nyctalus noctula
), we developed an ecophysiological approach that integrates metabolic rates, physiological states, and environmental conditions. Our model accurately hindcasted the northward range shift of this migratory bat over the past 50 years. Under climate change forecasts SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP3-7.0, and SSP5-8.5, for which winters will shorten by 1.4{\textendash}41 days and warm by 0.11{\textdegree}C{\textendash}2.3{\textdegree}C, the hibernation area is predicted to shift by 78{\textendash}732 km and expand north-eastward by 5.8\%{\textendash}14\% by 2100. Mean ambient temperature and winter duration prove sufficient to approximate the hibernation niche and may be used to predict changes in hibernation areas where collecting physiological measurements is difficult., Our study pioneers a methodology integrating empirical physiology measurements with climate models, enabling accurate predictions of the distribution of hibernating animals under projected climate change scenarios.},

	abstract = {The Spix's macaw (Cyanopsitta spixii), a Brazilian endemic psittacine formerly native to the north-eastern part of Bahia state has been classified as extinct in the wild since 2019. The entire ex-situ breeding population is currently managed by program-associated holders in Germany, Brazil and Belgium. Breeding efforts increased the global population under human care from a historical low of 53 individuals in 2000 to 364 individuals as of January 2025. The first two cohorts were released in the wild in June and December 2022 and the first wild-born offspring fledged successfully in May 2024. As part of the pre-release program, we studied the behavior of 123 birds in 2018-2019 within the German facility of the Association for the Conservation of Threatened Parrots e. V. (ACTP) with the goal to optimize general husbandry practices as well as pre-release and post-release protocols. We compiled an ethogram consisting of 75 non-sexual behaviors, monitored the time activity patterns of ten pairs during the daytime period, and analyzed the breeding output between 2014 and 2024. Our results reveal that the time activity patterns were relatively consistent across individuals. Nonetheless, each female was more in synchrony with its mate than with any other male. Moreover, breeding readiness and breeding success were strongly influenced by the synchronicity of the pairs. We discuss how the conservation of monogamous parrots could benefit from behavioral monitoring, drawing insights from the historical improvements in the reduction of behavioral disorders and in the increase in breeding success of the Spix's macaw.},
