## Current teaching and workshops

### Introductory course: Solving problems in biostatistical analysis and experimental design in the life sciences

Alex teaches this course at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (or [IZW](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/home.html)).

It is dedicated to PhD students from the IZW as well as to those belonging to one of the following programs:

- the [Research Training Group 2046 *Parasite Infections: From Experimental Models to Natural Systems* ](https://www.vetmed.fu-berlin.de/en/einrichtungen/sonstige/grk2046/index.html) also known as GRK 2046 or Grako.
- the [International Max Planck Research School for Infectious Diseases and Immunology](https://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/graduate_program/general_information) also known as ZIBI.
- the [Dahlem Research School](https://www.drs.fu-berlin.de/) also known as DRS.

The course is a 5 days block course occurring twice ever year: once in November or December and once in January or February (exact dates depend on the year).

This is an introductory course, so no preliminary knowledge in statistics or R is required.
It is however useful that students have their research question and experimental designs in mind.

Course content:

- day 1: basics of the statistical software and programming language called [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
- day 2-3: fundamental concepts in statistics such as: population, sample, distribution, null hypothesis, statistical significance, p-values, statistical power, mutliple testing, replications...
- day 3-4: non-parametric tests.
- day 4-5: linear models (LM, GLM) and a few other parametric tests.

Students need to bring a working laptop with charger and have installed the latest version of [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the course.

### R for Genetics and Genomics

Alex teaches this course with [Daniel Förster](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/daniel-foerster-en.html).

This one day practical course is part of a larger course on population genetics and genomics organised by [Jörns Fickel]() for [University of Potsdam](https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/university-of-potsdam?land=Irland).


### International Summer School on Stable Isotopes in Animal Ecology



## Former teaching

### Advanced course: solving problems in biostatistical analysis and experimental design in the life sciences

Alex taught this course at the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (or [IZW](https://www.izw-berlin.de/en/home.html)).

The point of this course was primarily to discuss and resolve every participant's (statistical) problem.

The course is no longer running since it became relativelly redundant with the bi-weekly statistical seminars from the IZW, which we co-organise with [Emanuel Heitlinger](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZgBJ3aAAAAAJ).
